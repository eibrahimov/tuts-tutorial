## 📚 SHARED KNOWLEDGE BASE

### Setting Up Team Memory

```
Team Lead: "Initialize team knowledge base:

Namespaces:
- 'team-patterns': Shared coding patterns
- 'architecture': System design decisions
- 'api-contracts': API specifications
- 'testing': Test strategies
- 'security': Security patterns

Set TTL to 0 (permanent) for critical patterns"
```

### Pattern Sharing Protocol

#### Creating a Pattern
```
Developer: "Created new pattern for form validation.
Store in 'team-patterns' namespace as 'form-validation-v2':
[pattern details]
Notify team in Slack #claude-flow channel"
```

#### Using Team Patterns
```
Developer: "Apply team pattern 'form-validation-v2'
to the migration application form"
```

#### Updating Patterns
```
Senior Dev: "Update pattern 'form-validation-v2':
- Add async validation support
- Include debouncing
- Version as 'form-validation-v3'
- Deprecate v2 with migration guide"
```

---

## 🔄 WORKFLOW COORDINATION

### Daily Standup Integration

#### Morning Sync
```
Each Developer: "What I completed yesterday:
[Claude-Flow shows yesterday's commits and patterns created]

What I'm working on today:
[Current task breakdown]

Blockers:
[Any Claude-Flow issues or pattern conflicts]"
```

### Sprint Planning

#### Story Estimation with Claude-Flow
```
Team Lead: "Estimate story points for:
'User can export migration documents as PDF'

Claude-Flow analysis:
- Complexity: Medium (existing PDF library)
- Components: 3 (generator, template, API)
- Tests needed: 15-20
- Patterns available: Yes (document-export)
- Estimate: 5 points"
```

### Code Review Process

#### Automated Pre-Review
```
Developer: "Review my changes before PR:
- Check against team patterns
- Verify test coverage
- Security scan
- Performance impact
- Suggest improvements"
```

#### Team Review Template
```
Reviewer: "Review PR #123 for:
- Pattern compliance: [team-patterns]
- Test coverage: [minimum 85%]
- Documentation: [required for public APIs]
- Performance: [no regression]
- Security: [OWASP compliance]"
```

## 🎯 PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT

### Feature Branch Strategy

#### Branch Initialization
```
Developer A: "Starting feature/user-dashboard
Store context in memory: 'feature-user-dashboard'
- Component structure
- State management approach
- API endpoints needed"
```

#### Conflict Prevention
```
Developer B: "Check for conflicts with feature/user-dashboard
before starting feature/admin-panel"

Claude-Flow: "Potential conflicts detected:
- Shared component: UserCard
- API endpoint: /api/users
- State slice: users

Recommendation: Coordinate on shared components"
```

### Merge Coordination

#### Pre-Merge Check
```
Developer: "Prepare for merge to main:
1. Check for conflicts
2. Run integration tests
3. Verify pattern compliance
4. Update documentation
5. Create merge summary"
```

---

## 💡 KNOWLEDGE SHARING

```
Team Lead: "Document our top 10 patterns:

1. Authentication Flow
2. Form Handling
3. API Error Management
4. State Management
5. Testing Strategy
6. Component Structure
7. Data Fetching
8. Caching Strategy
9. Security Practices
10. Performance Optimization

Store each with examples in team-patterns namespace"
```

### Learning Sessions

#### Weekly Pattern Review
```
Team: "Review this week's new patterns:
- Pattern name and purpose
- When to use
- Implementation example
- Lessons learned
- Q&A"
```

#### Pair Programming with Claude-Flow
```
Senior Dev: "Let's pair program the payment integration.
I'll guide the architecture while you implement with Claude-Flow.
Watch how I structure the prompts and use patterns."
```
