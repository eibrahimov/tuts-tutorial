# Prompt Engineering Mastery Guide

## üéØ THE ANATOMY OF A PERFECT PROMPT

### The Formula
```
[Context] + [Specific Task] + [Constraints] + [Expected Output] + [Success Criteria]
```

### Example Breakdown
```
[Context]: "In our Remix app using TypeScript and Prisma"
[Task]: "Create a user registration flow"
[Constraints]: "Must validate email, enforce strong passwords, prevent duplicates"
[Output]: "API endpoint, database schema, and tests"
[Success]: "95% test coverage, handles all edge cases"
```

## üìä PROMPT COMPLEXITY LEVELS

### Level 1: Basic (Junior)
```
"Fix the login bug"
```
**Result**: Claude searches, finds issue, fixes it

### Level 2: Specific (Mid)
```
"Fix the login bug where users with Gmail addresses
containing '+' symbols can't sign in. Update validation
regex and add test cases."
```
**Result**: Targeted fix with tests

### Level 3: Comprehensive (Senior)
```
"Fix the email validation bug in our authentication system:
- Issue: RFC 5322 compliant emails rejected
- Update both client and server validation
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Add comprehensive test suite (50+ cases)
- Document validation rules
- Store pattern for future use
- Performance: <10ms validation time"
```
**Result**: Complete solution with documentation and patterns

### Level 4: Strategic (Architect)
```
"Redesign our email validation strategy:
- Research RFC 5322, RFC 6531 (international)
- Create validation service with pluggable rules
- Support business rules (blocked domains, etc)
- Build performance benchmarks
- Create migration plan from current system
- Implement monitoring and analytics
- Generate validation rule documentation
- Train team patterns on new approach
Expected: Validation-as-a-service, 99.9% accuracy, <5ms response"
```
**Result**: Architectural solution with long-term vision

## üî• POWER PROMPTING TECHNIQUES

### Technique 1: Chain of Thought
```
You: "Build a payment processing system by thinking through:
1. First, identify payment providers we need
2. Then, design the database schema
3. Next, create the API abstraction layer
4. After that, implement provider integrations
5. Then, add error handling and retries
6. Finally, create comprehensive tests
Show your reasoning at each step"
```

### Technique 2: Few-Shot Learning
```
You: "Create API endpoints following these examples:

Example 1:
GET /api/users ‚Üí returns paginated users
POST /api/users ‚Üí creates user with validation

Example 2:
GET /api/products ‚Üí returns filtered products
POST /api/products ‚Üí creates product with image upload

Now create similar endpoints for 'orders' with these specific requirements:
- Order status workflow
- Payment integration
- Inventory check"
```

### Technique 3: Role-Based Prompting
```
You: "Act as a senior security engineer reviewing our authentication system.
Identify vulnerabilities, suggest improvements, and implement fixes.
Focus on OWASP Top 10 and assume an attacker's mindset."
```

### Technique 4: Socratic Prompting
```
You: "Before implementing user notifications:
- What notification channels do we need?
- How should we handle user preferences?
- What about rate limiting?
- How do we ensure delivery?
- What fallback mechanisms are needed?
Answer these, then implement the solution"
```

## üí° CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

### Minimal Context (Fast)
```
"Add pagination to the products API"
```

### Optimal Context (Balanced)
```
"Add pagination to our REST API /api/products endpoint:
- Current: Returns all products
- Need: Page-based pagination
- Constraints: Max 50 items per page
- Include: Total count, page metadata
- Compatible with existing filters"
```

### Maximum Context (Precise)
```
"Update our products API with pagination:
Context:
- Framework: Remix with Prisma ORM
- Database: PostgreSQL with 100k+ products
- Current endpoint: /api/products (GET)
- Existing features: Sorting, filtering by category

Requirements:
- Cursor-based pagination for performance
- Backward compatible with page-based
- Return metadata: hasNext, total, cursor
- Cache-friendly response headers
- Handle edge cases: deleted items, concurrent updates

Implementation:
- Use Prisma's cursor pagination
- Add response caching (5 min TTL)
- Include performance metrics
- Create migration guide for clients

Testing:
- Unit tests for pagination logic
- Integration tests with database
- Performance tests with 100k records
- Edge case coverage"
```

## üöÄ ADVANCED PROMPT PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Progressive Refinement
```
Iteration 1: "Create a basic user profile component"
Iteration 2: "Add edit functionality to the profile"
Iteration 3: "Include image upload with cropping"
Iteration 4: "Add validation and error handling"
Iteration 5: "Optimize for performance and accessibility"
```

### Pattern 2: Comparative Analysis
```
You: "Compare three approaches for implementing real-time updates:
1. WebSockets with Socket.io
2. Server-Sent Events (SSE)
3. Long polling

Analyze:
- Performance implications
- Scalability concerns
- Browser compatibility
- Implementation complexity
- Cost considerations

Recommend best approach for our use case and implement it"
```

### Pattern 3: Constraint-Driven Design
```
You: "Build a data export feature with these constraints:
- Memory limit: 512MB
- Time limit: 30 seconds
- File size limit: 100MB
- Must handle 1M records
- Non-blocking execution
- Progress reporting
- Resumable on failure"
```

### Pattern 4: Test-Driven Prompting
```
You: "Here are the tests for a shopping cart feature:
```javascript
describe('Shopping Cart', () => {
  test('adds items to cart');
  test('updates quantities');
  test('applies discount codes');
  test('calculates tax correctly');
  test('handles out of stock items');
});
```
Implement the feature to pass all these tests"
```

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with the goal, add constraints
2. **Use examples**: Show don't just tell
3. **Specify format**: Be clear about expected output
4. **Include non-goals**: What NOT to do
5. **Think step-by-step**: Break complex tasks down
6. **Iterate quickly**: Small improvements over perfection
7. **Store successful prompts**: Build your prompt library
8. **Learn from failures**: Analyze what went wrong
