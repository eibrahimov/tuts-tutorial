## 🟦 JUNIOR DEVELOPER PATH

### Day 1: First Steps (2 hours)

#### Hour 1: Understanding the Basics
```
1. Open Claude Code in your project
2. Try your first command:
   You: "Show me all the files in the src folder"

3. Try a simple fix:
   You: "Fix any ESLint errors in the codebase"

4. Try reading code:
   You: "Explain what the Login component does"
```

#### Hour 2: Your First Feature
```
You: "Create a simple Button component with these requirements:
- Accepts color prop (primary, secondary, danger)
- Has hover effects
- Includes TypeScript types
- Add unit tests"
```

**What Claude-Flow Does:**
1. Creates the component file
2. Adds TypeScript interfaces
3. Implements styling
4. Writes comprehensive tests
5. Ensures it follows project patterns

### Day 2: Working with Existing Code (3 hours)

#### Morning: Bug Fixes
```
You: "Find and fix the error in the user registration flow"
```

Watch how Claude-Flow:
- Searches relevant files
- Identifies the issue
- Proposes fix
- Tests the solution

#### Afternoon: Adding Features
```
You: "Add pagination to the products list with:
- 10 items per page
- Previous/Next buttons
- Page number display
- Keep existing filters working"
```

### Day 3-5: Building Confidence

#### Practice Tasks (Increasing Difficulty)

**Level 1: Simple Modifications**
```
"Add a loading spinner to all API calls"
"Update the color scheme to match new brand colors"
"Add form validation to the contact form"
```

**Level 2: New Features**
```
"Create a user preferences page with theme selection"
"Add export to CSV functionality to the data table"
"Implement remember me checkbox on login"
```

**Level 3: Complex Tasks**
```
"Add real-time notifications using WebSockets"
"Implement infinite scroll on the feed page"
"Create a drag-and-drop file uploader"
```

### Week 2: Learning Patterns

#### Understanding Memory
```
You: "Remember that we always use date-fns for date formatting"
Claude: [Stores in memory]

Later...
You: "Format the dates in the dashboard"
Claude: [Recalls date-fns preference and applies it]
```

#### Creating Your First Pattern
```
You: "Learn this pattern: We always wrap API calls in try-catch blocks
with specific error messages for each endpoint"

Claude: [Stores pattern and applies to future API work]
```

### Week 3-4: Collaboration

#### Working with Senior Developers
1. **Code Reviews**:
   ```
   You: "Review the authentication changes I made and suggest improvements"
   ```

2. **Pair Programming**:
   ```
   You: "Let's build the shopping cart together. You handle the state
   management while I work on the UI"
   ```

3. **Learning from Patterns**:
   ```
   You: "Show me the team's patterns for form handling"
   ```

## 🟪 SENIOR DEVELOPER PATH

### Day 1: Advanced Techniques (1 hour)

#### Immediate Productivity
```
You: "Analyze the entire codebase and identify:
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Code duplication
- Missing tests
Create a prioritized action plan"
```

#### Architecture Design
```
You: "Design a microservices architecture for our monolithic app with:
- Service boundaries
- Communication patterns
- Database strategy
- Deployment approach
Use SPARC architect mode"
```

### Day 2: Multi-Agent Orchestration

#### Complex Feature Development
```
You: "Build a complete real-time analytics dashboard:
- Backend: WebSocket server with Redis
- Frontend: React with real-time charts
- Database: Time-series data optimization
- Testing: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
- Documentation: API and user guides

Spawn specialized agents for each part working in parallel"
```

**What Happens:**
- Claude spawns 5+ specialized agents
- Each works on their domain
- Coordination through memory
- Integrated solution delivered

### Week 1: Pattern Development

#### Creating Team Patterns
```
You: "Analyze our authentication implementation and create
a reusable pattern for OAuth integration that includes:
- Provider abstraction
- Token management
- Error handling
- Testing strategy
Store this as 'oauth-pattern' for team use"
```

#### Teaching Claude-Flow Your Architecture
```
You: "Learn our domain-driven design approach:
- Aggregate boundaries: [list]
- Domain events: [list]
- Repository patterns: [examples]
- Use case structure: [template]
Apply this to all future development"
```

### Week 2: Optimization & Leadership

#### Performance Optimization
```
You: "Profile the application and implement optimizations:
- React component memoization
- API call deduplication
- Database query optimization
- Bundle size reduction
- Lazy loading implementation
Measure and report improvements"
```

#### Leading Team Adoption
1. **Create Team Playbook**:
   ```
   You: "Document our 10 most common development tasks
   as Claude-Flow patterns"
   ```

2. **Mentor Juniors**:
   ```
   You: "Create a learning path for junior developers
   to master our API development patterns"
   ```

3. **Establish Standards**:
   ```
   You: "Define code review checklist for AI-generated code"
   ```

## 🚀 UNIVERSAL SKILLS (Both Paths)

### Prompt Engineering Mastery

#### The Anatomy of a Perfect Prompt

**Structure:**
```
[Context] + [Specific Task] + [Constraints] + [Expected Output]
```

**Example:**
```
"Context: We're using NextJS with TypeScript and Tailwind
Task: Create a data table component
Constraints: Must be accessible, support sorting, and work on mobile
Output: Component with tests and Storybook story"
```

### Progressive Prompting

#### Level 1: Basic
```
"Fix the login bug"
```

#### Level 2: Specific
```
"Fix the login bug where users can't login with email addresses
containing + symbols"
```

#### Level 3: Comprehensive
```
"Fix the login validation bug:
- Issue: Email with + symbols fail validation
- Update regex pattern
- Add test cases for edge cases
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Update documentation"
```

#### Level 4: Strategic
```
"Fix the email validation bug and implement a comprehensive
email validation strategy:
- Research RFC 5322 compliance
- Create reusable validation utility
- Add client and server validation
- Include international domain support
- Generate test suite with 50+ test cases
- Document validation rules
- Store pattern for future use"
```

### Working with Memory

#### Storing Decisions
```
"Remember: We decided to use Zod for all validation schemas"
"Store pattern: Error messages should be user-friendly and actionable"
"Learn: Our API responses always include status, data, and error fields"
```

#### Recalling Information
```
"What did we decide about state management?"
"Apply our error handling pattern to this new endpoint"
"Use the authentication flow we established"
```

### Debugging with Claude-Flow

#### Systematic Approach
```
"Debug the payment processing issue:
1. Reproduce the error
2. Check logs and error messages
3. Trace the data flow
4. Identify root cause
5. Implement fix
6. Add tests to prevent regression
7. Document the solution"
```

### Testing Strategies

#### Comprehensive Test Generation
```
"Create tests for the UserService:
- Unit tests for all methods
- Integration tests with database
- Error scenario coverage
- Performance benchmarks
- Mock external dependencies
Aim for 95% coverage"
```
