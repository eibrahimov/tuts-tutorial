## 🚀 OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: Efficient Prompting

#### ❌ SLOW: Vague, Open-ended
```
"Build something for user management with all the features"
```

#### ✅ FAST: Specific, Bounded
```
"Create User CRUD API with:
- GET /users (paginated, max 50)
- POST /users (validate email, password)
- PUT /users/:id (partial updates)
- DELETE /users/:id (soft delete)
Use existing validation patterns"
```

#### 🚀 FASTEST: Pattern-Based
```
"Apply 'standard-crud' pattern to User model
with soft-delete and audit-fields"
```

---

### Strategy 2: Memory Optimization

#### Efficient Memory Usage
```
You: "Optimize memory storage:

1. List memory by size
2. Remove expired entries
3. Compress large patterns
4. Index frequently accessed
5. Cache hot patterns"
```

#### Memory Access Patterns
```javascript
// SLOW: Multiple retrievals
You: "Get pattern A"
You: "Get pattern B"
You: "Get pattern C"

// FAST: Batch retrieval
You: "Get patterns: ['A', 'B', 'C'] from namespace 'patterns'"
```

---

### Strategy 3: Agent Orchestration

#### Sequential (SLOW) ❌
```
You: "Create backend API"
[waits for completion]
You: "Create frontend UI"
[waits for completion]
You: "Create tests"
```

#### Parallel (FAST) ✅
```
You: "Build user management system:
Spawn parallel agents:
- Backend API (REST endpoints)
- Frontend UI (React components)
- Test Suite (Unit + Integration)
- Documentation (API + User)
Coordinate through 'user-mgmt' namespace"
```

#### Optimized Parallel (FASTEST) 🚀
```
You: "Execute user-mgmt-pattern with parallel agents:
Each agent uses pre-loaded patterns,
No discovery phase needed,
Share progress via memory"
```

---

## 📊 TOKEN OPTIMIZATION

### Reducing Token Usage

#### Technique 1: Context Management
```
You: "Compact context keeping only:
- Current task
- Active patterns
- Recent decisions
Remove:
- Completed tasks
- Redundant explanations
- Old errors"
```

#### Technique 2: Pattern Reuse
```
# First time: 5000 tokens
You: "Create authentication with JWT, refresh tokens, etc..."

# Next time: 500 tokens
You: "Apply auth-jwt pattern to new endpoint"
```

#### Technique 3: Incremental Building
```
# Instead of one 10k token request:
You: "Build complete e-commerce platform"

# Break into 5x 2k token requests:
You: "1. Create product model"
You: "2. Add product API"
You: "3. Create product UI"
You: "4. Add cart functionality"
You: "5. Implement checkout"
```

---

## 🎯 CACHING STRATEGIES

### Pattern Caching

```
You: "Cache frequently used patterns:

Hot Cache (instant access):
- CRUD operations
- Validation patterns
- Error handling
- Test structures

Warm Cache (quick access):
- Authentication flows
- API patterns
- Component templates

Cold Storage (on-demand):
- Specialized algorithms
- Legacy patterns
- Experimental features"
```

### Result Caching

```
You: "Cache computation results:
- TypeScript compilation results
- Test execution results
- Linting results
- Build artifacts
Reuse when files unchanged"
```

---

## 🔄 WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION

### Optimized Daily Workflow

#### Morning Setup (2 min)
```
You: "Quick start:
1. Load hot cache patterns
2. Restore yesterday's context
3. Prefetch likely patterns
4. Initialize agent pool"
```

#### Task Execution (Optimized)
```
You: "Execute task with optimizations:
- Skip exploration if pattern exists
- Reuse previous solutions
- Parallel independent steps
- Cache intermediate results"
```

#### End of Day (1 min)
```
You: "Optimize for tomorrow:
- Save successful patterns
- Clean failed attempts
- Compress memory
- Export metrics"
```

---

## ⚡ SPARC MODE OPTIMIZATION

### Fast SPARC Execution

```
You: "Run SPARC in optimized mode:
- Skip phases with existing patterns
- Parallel phase execution where possible
- Reuse specifications from memory
- Cache pseudocode for similar problems"
```

### SPARC Phase Timing

| Phase | Normal | Optimized | With Patterns |
|-------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Specification | 5 min | 2 min | 30 sec |
| Pseudocode | 5 min | 2 min | Skip |
| Architecture | 10 min | 5 min | 1 min |
| Refinement | 15 min | 8 min | 3 min |
| Completion | 5 min | 2 min | 1 min |
| **Total** | **40 min** | **19 min** | **5.5 min** |

---

## 🏎️ PERFORMANCE PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Batch Operations

```javascript
// SLOW: Individual operations
for (const file of files) {
  You: `Process ${file}`
}

// FAST: Batched operation
You: `Process all files: ${files.join(', ')} in parallel`
```

### Pattern 2: Early Termination

```
You: "Find and fix the login bug:
- Stop after first bug found
- Don't scan entire codebase
- Focus on auth-related files only"
```

### Pattern 3: Progressive Enhancement

```
You: "Build feature progressively:
1. Minimal working version (2 min)
2. Add validation (1 min)
3. Add tests (2 min)
4. Optimize if needed (1 min)
Stop when good enough"
```

---

## 📈 MEASURING PERFORMANCE

### Performance Tracking

```
You: "Track performance metrics:

Per Task:
- Start/end time
- Token count
- Memory hits/misses
- Agent utilization
- Cache effectiveness

Daily:
- Average response time
- Total tokens used
- Pattern reuse rate
- Parallel execution rate"
```

### Performance Dashboard

```javascript
// Weekly Performance Report
{
  "averageResponseTime": "8.5s",
  "tokenEfficiency": "3.2k/task",
  "patternReuseRate": "73%",
  "parallelExecutionRate": "61%",
  "cacheHitRate": "84%",
  "improvement": "+34% vs last week"
}
```

preload related patterns:
- JWT handling
- Password hashing
- Session management
- OAuth flows"
```

### Agent Pool Management

```
You: "Maintain agent pool:
- Keep 3 idle agents ready
- Specialize agents by domain

```
You: "Decompose task optimally:
- Identify independent subtasks
- Group related operations
- Minimize dependencies

## 💡 OPTIMIZATION TIPS

### Tip 1: Use Existing First
```
You: "Before creating new, check if exists:
- Search patterns library
- Check team namespace
- Look for similar solutions
Only create if truly unique"
```

### Tip 2: Fail Fast
```
You: "Validate approach early:
- Test core assumption first
- Verify feasibility
- Check for blockers
Don't waste time on wrong path"
```

### Tip 3: Lazy Loading
```
You: "Load only what's needed:
- Start with minimal context
- Load patterns on demand
- Fetch details when required
- Clean up after use"
```
